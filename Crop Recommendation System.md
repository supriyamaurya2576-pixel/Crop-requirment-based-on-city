**Crop Recommendation System**

**Project Statement**

A Python-based system designed to help farmers identify the most suitable crops according to the climatic conditions of their city and to display detailed crop requirements for better agricultural planning.

-----
**Objective**

To support farmers in making informed crop selection decisions by providing climate-based crop suggestions and resource requirements such as:

- Soil type
- Temperature range
- Rainfall requirement
- Cultivation season
- Growth duration (when applicable)
-----
**How It Works**

1. The user enters a city name.
1. The system displays:
   1. The climate description of the city
   1. A list of suitable crops
1. The user selects a crop, and the program displays its full agricultural requirements.

**Expected Outcome**

The system enables farmers to:

- Understand regional climate conditions
- Identify crops that match the weather and soil profile
- Reduce risk and increase productivity through informed decisions
-----
**Future Improvements**

- Add more cities and crop datasets
- Provide fertilizer and disease management recommendations
- Web or Android application interface
- Local language support
