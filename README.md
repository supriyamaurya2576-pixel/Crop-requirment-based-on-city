# Crop-requirment-based-on-city
This Python program shows soil, temperature, and rainfall requirements for crops like jowar, cotton, pepper, and root vegetables. Users enter a crop name, and the program uses if–elif–else conditions to display the correct details. It is simple, accurate, and easy to extend with more crops.
